This project introduces a dual-mode intelligent footwear recommendation system designed specifically for runners. Users can either fill out a detailed questionnaire regarding their foot type, running habits, and terrain preference, or simply upload a photo of their foot. The system utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze the image and classify foot arch type (flat, normal, or high), which is a critical factor in determining the right type of athletic shoe. By combining machine learning with personalized input, the app ensures that runners are matched with shoes that support their biomechanics, reduce injury risk, and enhance comfort during performance. Unlike existing shoe fit apps that focus only on size or virtual try-ons, this system incorporates both biomechanical factors and activity-specific requirements such as trail vs. road running. It bridges the gap between general foot scanning tools and sport-specific injury prevention tools, offering runners a scientifically informed, accessible, and user-friendly solution. The goal is not only to recommend footwear but to empower athletes with data- driven choices that improve their running health and experience
